# 1.0 About JC.Unit

JC.Unit is a framework for testing BI solutions. It is supporting
multiple platforms such as MS SQL, Excel, Oracle, PostgreSQL. Its scope
includes relational databases, olap/cubes databases, etc.

The main goal of this framework is to let users create tests easily and
test their data - JC.Unit has a very simple configuration.

The folder *'[Sample Files](https://github.com/joyfulcraftsmen/JC.Tools/tree/main/JC.Unit/Documentation/SampleFiles)'* contains following files and folders for setting your first test:
- **SQLScripts folder**: here are SQL scripts that allow you to create TestDefinition and ConnectionDefinition tables in an MS SQL database.  
- **JC.Unit.json file**: the main JC.Unit configuration file. The file is defined for easy running of the first test.  
- **PersonsEmail.xlsx** and **PersonsInfo.xlsx**: two datasets just for purpose of running the first test.  
- **RunTest.ps1**: this file contains powershell script for running tests.  
- **TestDefinitions.yaml**: here is defined the first test.  

The *'Sample Files'* folder does not contain JC.Unit or JC.Unit.Runner.

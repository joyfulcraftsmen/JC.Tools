# 4.0 How to run test-suite

There are 3 ways to run tests.  
- Tests can be run locally in the **command line**, more information can be found in [subchapter 4.1](https://github.com/cernatery/JC.Tools/blob/main/JC.Unit/Documentation/4.1%20How%20to%20run%20test-suite%20locally%20in%20Command%20line.md).
- The second way is to run the test locally by **JC.Unit.Runner**, more in [subchapter 4.2](https://github.com/cernatery/JC.Tools/blob/main/JC.Unit/Documentation/4.2%20How%20to%20run%20test-suite%20locally%20using%20JC.Unit.Runner.md).
- The last way is to run the test in the **pipeline**, details you can find in [subchapter 4.3](https://github.com/cernatery/JC.Tools/blob/main/JC.Unit/Documentation/4.3%20How%20to%20run%20test-suite%20in%20the%20pipeline.md).

# Conclusion

You just created you first test and saw the result of it. You already may have a feeling, that there's lot of what can be tested on your data. I also already might have noticed, that adding connections to other sources and adding more tests is crazy simple in JC.Unit.

What if we say you there is more? 

* You can e.g. store your tests in MS Excel files and let business users to add more tests? (Basic knowledge is sufficient for that.) 

* What if you can have your tests defined also in a database table and automatically generate them? Implement something like "There is never any empty dimension table nor fact table" test is easy-peasy.

* Data testing is not only about comparing data. Some queries should never ever return data. Some should return exactly n rows. No problem.

* ...

The options you have for testing data with JC.Unit are realy wide. Don't stop with this tutorial - explore more!

Where to go next? You know have a pretty good idea about how JC.Unit works. So you might want to know:

* know all the details: [JC.Unit Reference](../index),
* see other options where to store [connection definitions](../connections) and [test definitions](../tests)
* learn about all [types of tests](../typesoftests) you can perform on your data
* how to use [JC.Unit in Azure DevOps pipeline](../quick-start-devops/intro).

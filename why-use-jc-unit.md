# Why use JC.Unit

## Why should I test data?

The answer is simple: **You will significantly INCREASE TRUST into your data.**

Do you have data? Do you trust them? Cover them with automated tests, and you will. You will *know* your data are OK, not just *expect* they are. This tool is primarily just about that. Define tests with almost no effort and be sure you can trust your data.

## What is JC.Unit?

**JC.Unit is a framework for testing data.** It helps you back your data with hundreds or tousands of automated tests in no time. 

Whenever you have a need for testing data, JC.Unit is your friend. It is handy for testing e.g.,:

* BI solutions
* ETL processes
* data processing / transformation engines
* computation logic.

But these are definitelly not the only use cases. Generally, any applications that intensively work with data will benefit from data testing with JC.Unit.

## What data sources are supported?
JC.Unit provides out of the box connectors to major data sources. Relational databases, MS Excel, analytical models, such as

* MS SQL Server 
* ORACLE 
* MS Excel
* PostgreSQL
* SSAS / Power BI

The number of connectors is growing and they are very easy to add.

Sounds reasonable? OK, let's [get JC.Unit](get-jc-unit) and [setup first test](create-first-test).
